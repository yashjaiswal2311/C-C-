/*o/p is [a= +32766,d= -32767]

if we don't write signed by default it is signed. 

by value chart if we assign value value than the 65535 then it will run clock wise and if less than 0 then
anti-clock wise

if we want to make any variable unsigned then we need to mention unsigned keyword other by default it will 
take it as signed.*/
